##Overall Concept

##Topics, Partitions and Offset
![](./2.1 Kafka Theory/Screen Shot 2021-09-13 at 5.08.47 PM.png)

Each topic will have a particular set of partitions and each partition will have offset (infinite number).


###Example

##Brokers
![](./2.1 Kafka Theory/Screen Shot 2021-09-13 at 5.19.31 PM.png)

- Brokers are indentified only the **number**
- Cluster means list of servers. Each server will act as the broker.
- When we create multiple partitions for a topic, they could end up in different available in different broker (as below).

You only need to connect to one broker (any broker) and just provide the topic name you want to write to. Kafka Clients will route your data to the appropriate brokers and partitions for you!

##Topic Replication Factor

When the **Broker 101** is down, then **partition-0 of topic-A** in the broder **102** will become the leader. When the 101 machine comes backup, it'll try to become a leader after replicating all the data from the broker 102. It is done by **zookeeper** at the backend **automatically**.

##Producers and Message Keys
![](./2.1 Kafka Theory/Screen Shot 2021-09-13 at 5.54.55 PM.png)
Data load balancing will be in round robin way if **no key** is specified.

Producer can choose to receive acknowledgement of data writes:

|acks|Meaning|
|---|---|
|0|Producer won't wait for acknowledgement (potential data loss)|
|1|Producer will wait for leader's acknowledgement (limited data loss)|
|all|Producer will wait for leader + replica's acknowledgement (no data loss)|

It is based on **hasing**

##Consumers and Consumer groups
![](./2.1 Kafka Theory/Screen Shot 2021-09-13 at 6.03.47 PM.png)

One consumer may read data from 2 partitions so order is not guaranteed. But the order of data from one partition is maintained and from other partition is also maintained.

##Consumer Offsets

You only need to connect to one broker (any broker) and just provide the topic name you want to read from. Kafka will route your calls to the appropriate brokers and partitions for you!

Two consumers that have the same group.id (consumer group id) will read from mutually exclusive partitions.

Kafka Consumer Offsets are stored in topic **\_\_consumer\_offsets** in kafka itself (not in zookeeper)
